# UPES-Semester-3
- This repository belongs to the third semester of my college.
- This semester contained a lot of important subjects like Applied Statistics, Introduction to Artificial intelligence, Basics of Object Oriented Programming (JAVA).
- This repo contains the codes for all the assignments, I got for these subjects.
- Happy Coding üßëüèª‚Äçüíª.....


## Applied Statistics üìä
### Approximate idea of Experiments for Applied Statistics folder. Although, the doc of detailed problem statements is also added in the folder.
- Experiment-1: The assignment contains a file. Read the file as a data frame in python. List the type of data that each column represents. Finally, use the proper measure of central tendency for each. What do you think of the missing value?
- Experiment-2: The assignment contains a file. Read the file as a data frame in python. Find the range, standard deviation and variance for each of the variables. (Discuss measures of dispersion for Nominal and Ordinal Data).
- Experiment-3: 1) Generate a random sample with mean = 5, standard deviation = 2.  2) Plot the distribution. 3) Give the summary statistics.
- Experiment-4: Create a dataset of a single variable comprising of only numerical values. Create a Normal distribution for it. Convert it to Z distribution and plot both of the distribution.
- Experiment-5: Import the z table as a data structure in python. Create some 5 demo examples to find the area under the curve and report the answer from the z-table.
- Experiemtn-6: In Lab 1 we discussed a dataset having variables 'Marks' and 'CGPI'. Plot both of them as two different axes. Discuss the covariance and correlation coefficient.
- Experiment-7: Observe the dataset: [https://www.kaggle.com/subhashinimariappan/numerical-dataset]. Compute all the statistical measures learnt till the last class: central tendency, dispersion, covariance, correlation, equation of a straight line for all comb. where r>0.6.
- Experiment-8: Write notes on Markov Chains and Hidden Markov Model. Try to code in python.
- Experiment-9: Create a random variable and insert 1000 random numbers (population). Plot the distribution. Create 30 samples from the population each of size 100. Compute the means and finally find the sampling distribution (plot).


## Artificial Intelligence Lab ü§ñ
### Approximate idea of Experiments for Artificial Intelligence folder. Although, the doc of detailed problem statements is also added in the folder.
- Write a program to solve different set operations using python.
- Write a program to implement propositional logic in AI.
- Write a program to implement Tautologies, and Contradiction.
- Write a program to implement Bayesian Network in a given real-world problem. Compute the accuracy of the Bayesian Network, considering few test data sets. (Monty Hall Problem)
- Design and implement Bayesian Network for real-world data sets. (Burglary Alarm Problem)
- Write a program to solve the Travelling Salesperson algorithm for a real-world problem.
- Design and implement a Perceptron learner and Neural Networks learner and test on real-world problem data sets.
- Write a program to implement the linear regression, multiple linear regression algorithm, and Logistic Regression algorithms to fit data points. Select the appropriate data set for your experiment and draw graphs.
- Write a program to solve Wumpus World Problem.
- Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree algorithm. Use an appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge to classify a new sample.
