# UPES-Semester-3
- This repository belongs to the third semester of my college.
- This semester contained a lot of important subjects like Applied Statistics, Introduction to Artificial intelligence, Basics of Object Oriented Programming (JAVA).
- This repo contains the codes for all the assignments, I got for these subjects.
- Happy Coding 🧑🏻‍💻.....


## Applied Statistics 📊
### Approximate idea of Experiments for Applied Statistics folder. Although, the doc of detailed problem statements is also added in the folder.
- Experiment-1: The assignment contains a file. Read the file as a data frame in python. List the type of data that each column represents. Finally, use the proper measure of central tendency for each. What do you think of the missing value?
- Experiment-2: The assignment contains a file. Read the file as a data frame in python. Find the range, standard deviation and variance for each of the variables. (Discuss measures of dispersion for Nominal and Ordinal Data).
- Experiment-3: 1) Generate a random sample with mean = 5, standard deviation = 2.  2) Plot the distribution. 3) Give the summary statistics.
- Experiment-4: Create a dataset of a single variable comprising of only numerical values. Create a Normal distribution for it. Convert it to Z distribution and plot both of the distribution.
- Experiment-5: Import the z table as a data structure in python. Create some 5 demo examples to find the area under the curve and report the answer from the z-table.
- Experiemtn-6: In Lab 1 we discussed a dataset having variables 'Marks' and 'CGPI'. Plot both of them as two different axes. Discuss the covariance and correlation coefficient.
- Experiment-7: Observe the dataset: [https://www.kaggle.com/subhashinimariappan/numerical-dataset]. Compute all the statistical measures learnt till the last class: central tendency, dispersion, covariance, correlation, equation of a straight line for all comb. where r>0.6.
- Experiment-8: Write notes on Markov Chains and Hidden Markov Model. Try to code in python.
- Experiment-9: Create a random variable and insert 1000 random numbers (population). Plot the distribution. Create 30 samples from the population each of size 100. Compute the means and finally find the sampling distribution (plot).


## Artificial Intelligence Lab 🤖
### Approximate idea of Experiments for Artificial Intelligence folder. Although, the doc of detailed problem statements is also added in the folder.
- Lab Exercise-1: Basic Linux Commands




## Object Oriented Programming (JAVA) 🧑🏻‍💻
### Approximate idea of Experiments for JAVA's folder. Although, the doc of detailed problem statements is also added in the folder.

- Experiment-1: Find sum of all array elements using recursion.
